Thank You to # martaionic


## Features
marta.io displays realtime MARTA API results for trains, updated every 10s. It breaks this data down into three views:

1. Dashboard

  The main view, a list of stations shows when you first launch the app. If location access is granted, the three closest stations stick to the top. Dragging left on a station lets you star it, which will put it at the very top of your list for quick access.

2. Station View

  Tap a station on the dashboard and you can see its upcoming trains, with schedule data mixed in if no realtime data is present for a given direction.
  By tapping a station you can see the buses that are attached and their direction of travel.

3. Train View

  After drilling down to station view, a second tap on a train takes you to that train's estimates. This is useful if you want to know when your train is estimated to arrive at a future station.
